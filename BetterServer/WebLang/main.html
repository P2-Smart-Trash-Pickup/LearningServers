        <h1>Phew! What's That Smell?<br>(It's Martin!)</h1>

        <p>Martin refuses to take a bath. He smells. It's not just a bad smell. It's a smell that lingers in the air, sticks to clothes, clings to walls, stays in your nostrils long after he's gone. People turn away when he walks by. They hold their breath. Some move discreetly, others don't. They say things like: "For fuck's sake, Martin," or just: "Jesus Christ." He doesn't react. He keeps walking. His clothes are greasy. They haven't been washed for weeks, maybe months. It's hard to say what the smell actually is. There's something rotten about it, something sour, something old. Sweat, urine, sour milk. Something that was once food. Something that was once human. Martin doesn't notice the reactions around him. Or maybe he does, but chooses to ignore them. It's a choice, some people think. He does it on purpose. Others believe he just doesn't understand. That he can't smell himself. That he's gotten used to it. But they all have the same thought when he walks past: How can he stand it?</p>
